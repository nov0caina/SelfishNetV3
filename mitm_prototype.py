# Demonstrates basic ARP spoofing and packet forwarding using Scapy.
# IMPORTANT: This script requires root privileges to send/receive raw packets
# and manipulate network configurations.
# Run with sudo: sudo python3 mitm_prototype.py
#
# Network Setup Considerations:
# - IP forwarding on the attacker machine:
#   - For this script to fully control forwarding:
#     Linux: sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
#     macOS: sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=0
#   - If OS forwarding is ON, the OS might also forward packets, which can
#     sometimes interfere or make the script's forwarding redundant.
#     This script aims to do the forwarding itself.
